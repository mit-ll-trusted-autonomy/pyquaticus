    This class provides functions for registering observation elements

    vector with elements in [-1, 1].

    An additional benefit of this class is that the order of observations
    is automatically managed (and corresponds to registration order). The
    raw observations should be passed as a dictionary with keys corresponding
    to the registered observation elements.
